## Risk Register Overview

This risk register identifies, assesses, and tracks risks throughout the project lifecycle. Risks are continuously monitored and updated as the project progresses.

---

## Risk Rating Matrix

### Probability Levels
- **Very High (5):** > 80% chance of occurring
- **High (4):** 60-80% chance of occurring
- **Medium (3):** 40-60% chance of occurring
- **Low (2):** 20-40% chance of occurring
- **Very Low (1):** < 20% chance of occurring

### Impact Levels
- **Critical (5):** Project failure, major financial loss, severe security breach
- **High (4):** Significant delays, substantial cost overruns, major feature cuts
- **Medium (3):** Moderate delays, budget impact, some feature modifications
- **Low (2):** Minor delays, small budget impact, minimal scope changes
- **Very Low (1):** Negligible impact on project

### Risk Score
**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**

- **20-25:** Critical Risk - Immediate action required
- **15-19:** High Risk - Priority attention needed
- **10-14:** Medium Risk - Monitor closely
- **5-9:** Low Risk - Monitor periodically
- **1-4:** Very Low Risk - Accept and document

### Risk #001: Third-Party API Dependency

#### Classification
- **Risk ID:** R-001
- **Category:** Technical
- **Sub-Category:** Integration
- **Date Identified:** 2024-01-15
- **Identified By:** Jane Smith
- **Status:** Monitoring

#### Risk Description
The payment processing API we're integrating with has experienced outages in the past and may become unavailable or change their API contract without sufficient notice.

#### Impact Description
If the payment API becomes unavailable, users will not be able to complete purchases, resulting in lost revenue and poor user experience. API contract changes could break our integration, requiring emergency fixes.

#### Assessment
- **Probability:** 3 (Medium - API has had 2 outages in the past year)
- **Impact:** 5 (Critical - directly affects revenue)
- **Risk Score:** 15
- **Risk Level:** High

#### Triggers and Warning Signs
- Increased response times from API
- Error rate spikes
- Announcements in vendor's developer forum
- Deprecation notices

#### Affected Areas
- Checkout flow
- Payment processing module
- Order confirmation system
- Revenue reporting

#### Mitigation Strategy
**Strategy Type:** Reduce + Transfer

**Preventive Actions:**
1. Implement circuit breaker pattern to handle API failures gracefully
2. Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Subscribe to vendor's status page and developer announcements
4. Identify and evaluate backup payment processors
5. Implement API contract testing in CI/CD pipeline
6. Cache payment gateway status and fail fast when unavailable

**Estimated Cost:** $8,000 (80 hours of development)  
**Responsible Party:** Backend Team Lead  
**Target Date:** 2024-02-28  
**Status:** In Progress

#### Contingency Plan
If API becomes unavailable:
1. Activate fallback payment processor within 30 minutes
2. Display maintenance message to users explaining temporary payment method changes
3. Send email notifications to users with pending transactions
4. Contact vendor support for estimated resolution time
5. Monitor error rates and user complaints
6. Prepare communication for customers about alternative payment methods

**Estimated Cost:** $5,000 (50 hours + potential revenue loss)  
**Response Time:** 30 minutes to activate fallback  
**Responsible Party:** DevOps + Backend teams

#### Residual Risk
After mitigation:
- **Residual Probability:** 2 (Low - with fallback in place)
- **Residual Impact:** 3 (Medium - still some user disruption)
- **Residual Risk Score:** 6 (Low)

#### Timeline
- **Identified:** 2024-01-15
- **Mitigation Started:** 2024-01-20
- **Target Resolution:** 2024-02-28
- **Actual Resolution:** N/A

#### Updates and History
| Date | Update | Updated By |
|------|--------|------------|
| 2024-01-15 | Risk identified during architecture review | Jane Smith |
| 2024-01-20 | Mitigation plan approved, work started | John Doe |
| 2024-02-01 | Circuit breaker implementation complete | Backend Team |
| 2024-02-15 | Fallback processor integration 50% complete | Backend Team |

### Risk #002: Key Developer Leaving

#### Classification
- **Risk ID:** R-002
- **Category:** Operational
- **Sub-Category:** Skills/Resources
- **Date Identified:** 2024-01-10

- **Status:** Open

#### Risk Description
The lead frontend developer has expressed interest in moving to a different role or company. They possess critical knowledge about the application architecture and custom components that aren't well documented.

#### Impact Description
Loss of this developer would slow down frontend development significantly and could delay the project by 4-6 weeks while a replacement is found and onboarded.

#### Assessment
- **Probability:** 3 (Medium - developer is actively interviewing)
- **Impact:** 4 (High - significant project impact)
- **Risk Score:** 12
- **Risk Level:** Medium

#### Triggers and Warning Signs
- Developer taking more time off than usual
- Less engagement in team meetings
- Updating LinkedIn profile
- Mentions of job interviews

#### Affected Areas
- Frontend development timeline
- React component library
- UI/UX implementation
- Team morale

#### Mitigation Strategy
**Strategy Type:** Reduce

**Preventive Actions:**
1. Conduct stay interview to understand concerns and address if possible
2. Implement pair programming to distribute knowledge
3. Create comprehensive documentation of architecture and key components
4. Cross-train another frontend developer on critical systems
5. Record video walkthroughs of complex components
6. Start recruiting for a backup frontend developer

**Estimated Cost:** $3,000 (documentation + training time)  
**Responsible Party:** Engineering Manager  
**Target Date:** 2024-02-15  
**Status:** In Progress

#### Contingency Plan
If developer leaves:
1. Offer extended notice period with bonus for knowledge transfer
2. Accelerate hiring process for replacement
3. Engage contractors for short-term coverage
4. Re-prioritize features to focus on backend work while ramping up new frontend dev
5. Consider promoting junior developer with senior contractor support

**Estimated Cost:** $50,000 (recruiting + contractor costs)  
**Response Time:** Begin within 1 day of notice  
**Responsible Party:** HR + Engineering Manager

#### Residual Risk
After mitigation:
- **Residual Probability:** 3 (Medium - may still leave)
- **Residual Impact:** 2 (Low - impact reduced with knowledge transfer)
- **Residual Risk Score:** 6 (Low)
